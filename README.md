<h3>Inverted Search Engine using Hash Table and Linked Lists in C</h3>

<p>Developed a file-based Inverted Search Engine in C that indexes multiple text files and enables fast word-based searching. The system uses a Hash Table combined with Linked Lists to efficiently map each unique word to the files in which it appears along with occurrence counts.
  This project demonstrates core Data Structures, file handling, and memory management concepts in C.</p>
